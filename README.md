# KMKfw-POG
These are the "firmware" files for my custom hand wired ergonomic linear keyboards.

I am using [KMK](https://kmkfw.io/) and [POG](https://pog.heaper.de/) on a [Boardsource](https://www.boardsource.xyz) [Blok](https://www.boardsource.xyz/products/blok) controller.

The first board I've added is named BlueWaveEL, and is a 52 key (5 row, 12 column) single board, "split", column stagger layout.
